I started working with her in 2017 with no gym experience, and she provided me with the fundamental knowledge I needed to enter the gym with confidence.

We've been back at it for two years, and her careful attention to planning my workout and meals around my busy schedule is top tier. Beth is the accountability partner everyone needs. She takes your journey very seriously and is sure to stretch you based on your fitness goals.
